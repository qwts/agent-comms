## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Machine broker between persona accounts (ADR-0006): the owner runs
  `agent-comms broker run`, accounts pair once with owner approval, and the
  broker verifies the account on every call.
- `agent-comms` CLI with `join`, `leave`, `whoami`, `peers`, `send`,
  `inbox read`/`watch`/`ack`, `account pair`/`status`, `broker run`/`pairings`/
  `approve`/`revoke`, and `skill` subcommands; one JSON document on stdout,
  stable error codes on failure.
- Durable mailbox with per-soul cursors and a JSON Lines watch stream
  (ADR-0004); A2A handled at the broker edge (ADR-0005).
- `agent-comms` skill with `setup` and `messaging` references; souls are
  claims in this release and the broker verifies accounts (ADR-0003).
- Architecture decisions ADR-0002 through ADR-0007; the messaging plane runs
  on the agent-bot daemon contract with zero runtime npm dependencies.
- Homebrew formula at `Formula/agent-comms.rb`, tapped by URL and installed
  from the release tag with Homebrew's Node.
- Release pipeline: `scripts/release` prepares a release PR that bumps every
  version site, and the Release workflow tags and publishes it after merge.
